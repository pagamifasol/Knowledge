- Development in Boston USA (static and dynamic machines, statically placed)

- Dynamic machines in ..

- Machine for plastic/composite impact test in Pianezza ITA

- IST in Germany full car testing

100kN - actuator in the base

250kN - actuator in the base, better frequency response, taller specimens

250kN - up to 3m tall, maximum flexibility, actuator on the top

Software and loacell all manufactured by Instrom.

There is an accessory furnace.

The stiffness of the specimen is measured by a patented system before starting the test (30 seconds).

Pumps can be added in parallel.

For load cycle fatigues tests is better a small servo valve: there is the possibility to have 2 small or 1 small and 1 big for high speed tests.

There is a chiller to cool down the oil. The pump/chiller unit is noisy and usually mounted far from the machine.

Software is fragmented for different purposes: fatigue, low cycle fatigue, static...


There are optional loadcells to improve accuracy for lower force tests. Accuracy is 0.5% of indicated load or 0.0002% ? of loacell maximum?
